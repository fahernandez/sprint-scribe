# Statement of Work

## Objective
Design and implement an architecture that integrates Client A Data Science (DS) Platform requirements into existing data-science and machine-learning processes.

## Solution Constraints
- **Snowflake** must be the primary data platform.  
- **Databricks** must be the core machine-learning environment.  
- Minimize data stored in Databricks—retain only what is required for model governance and observability as defined in Client A’s DS Platform requirements.  
- Prioritize implementation, documentation, and adoption of the most critical MLOps requirements specified in the Client A DS Platform requirements document.  

## Implementation Specifics

### Phase 1 – Design & Discovery
- Define, validate, and document the Databricks environment configuration, RBAC model, and compute architecture.  
- Design, validate, and document the MLflow configuration in Databricks for model registry and experiment tracking.  
- Design, validate, and document the Databricks Lakehouse configuration for model-performance monitoring and observability.  

### Phase 2 – Implementation

#### Infostrux Responsibilities
- Develop a **GitHub template project** that integrates:  
  - User-access provisioning and configuration  
  - Model versioning with Databricks MLflow (examples + docs aligned to Client A best practices)  
  - GitHub Workflows for Databricks project bundling and model promotion across Client A environments  
  - Experiment tracking with Databricks MLflow (examples + docs for reproducibility & performance monitoring)  
  - Local development and Databricks UI notebook development  
  - Reusable pipeline functionality to accelerate project kick-off  
- Implement an end-to-end ML use case with the template, demonstrating all Client A MLOps requirements.  
- Coordinate environment, RBAC, compute, MLflow, and Lakehouse implementation with Databricks Professional Services.  

#### Databricks Professional Services Responsibilities
- Deploy the environment configuration, RBAC model, and compute architecture for Client A.  
- Deploy the MLflow configuration for Client A.  
- Deploy the Databricks Lakehouse configuration for Client A.

## Timeline Breakdown

| Phase | Weeks  | Description | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **1** | 1 – 4 | • Define, validate & document Databricks environment, RBAC model, compute architecture.<br>• Design, validate & document MLflow configuration for registry & tracking.<br>• Design, validate & document Lakehouse configuration for monitoring & observability. | Validated design & documentation of Databricks MLOps architecture (environment, RBAC, compute, MLflow integration, Lakehouse monitoring & observability). |
| **2** | 5 – 8 | **Infostrux:** Build GitHub template (see Phase 2 details) and coordinate infra with Databricks PS.<br>**Databricks PS:** Deploy environment, RBAC, compute; deploy MLflow & Lakehouse configs for Client A. | • GitHub template embodying Client A MLOps best practices.<br>• Databricks Professional Services project management. |
|       | 9 – 10 | Implement end-to-end ML use case using the new template, demonstrating all Client A MLOps requirements. | End-to-end ML use-case implementation leveraging the template. |
|       | 11 – 12 | Solution adoption & improvements; project-documentation updates; hand-over. | Final documentation and feedback-driven refinements. |

## Design Considerations
- **Unity Catalog** must be enabled across workspaces for artifact promotion, governance, and cross-environment monitoring.  
- Environment RBAC and compute configuration must comply with Client A governance policies.  
- Model registry design should support automatic model promotion across environments.  
- The template project will be developed in close collaboration with the Client A DS team, starting from an existing project, integrating new MLOps best practices, and undergoing User Acceptance Testing (UAT).  
- The template should enable reusable pipelines; a separate project may be required for custom Python-library storage and versioning—validate this approach with the DS team.  
- Service roles **only** must be used for asset promotion across environments to ensure auditability, security, and compliance.  
- Model-performance monitoring must include clearly defined acceptance thresholds and contingency plans.
